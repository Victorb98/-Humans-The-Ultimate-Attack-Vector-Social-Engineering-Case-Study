# 🛡🧐Humans The Ultimate Attack-Vector Social-Engineering Case-Study

Human error is not a small part of cybersecurity  
It is the battlefield. 
This project explores how attackers target people, why humans remain the weakest link, and how security teams can detect and mitigate these attacks.  
It combines a portfolio case study with an educational breakdown designed to show clear communication and SOC-level thinking.

# 🧠 Summary

This project explains how cyber attackers manipulate human psychology and how defenders can identify and prevent these attacks.  
It includes

• Social engineering concepts  
• Realistic examples of impersonation, phishing and trust abuse  
• Analyst style breakdowns of attacker goals  
• Mitigation and detection techniques  
• Visual Q and A sequences illustrating each concept  

This is designed as a high-value easy to easy-to-understand infosec project that demonstrates analytical thinking and communication skills.

These illustrate the difference between mitigation and detection and how attackers weaponise emotion like urgency and trust.

## Q3 Impersonation

Impersonation remains one of the most successful social engineering methods because humans trust authority and familiar roles.

## Q4 Humans as the Weakest Link

This section highlights the reality that technology rarely fails first. Humans do.

## Q5 What Attackers Want  
 <img width="1824" height="188" alt="Humans attack vector project question 5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebdddec0-02f4-4e89-ba36-77595b208157" />

Attackers target people because people hold access. Credentials email accounts, portals, wallets and internal systems.

## Q6 Training as a Mitigation  
  <img width="1811" height="153" alt="Humans attack vector project question 6" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ec188a8-8eb1-4863-a650-043cc1332f38" />

Security awareness training remains a high-impact defensive measure when applied correctly and consistently.

## Q7 Security Policy Challenge  
 <img width="1822" height="170" alt="Humans attack vector project question 7" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a669453-5e42-4f2b-87c9-15631bce4156" />

This section highlights four essential mitigation pillars  
Antivirus  
Anti-phishing tools  
Access management policies  
Security awareness programs  

The final flag THM{human_protection_expert!} represents completing the human defence learning objectives.

# 🚀 How to Use This Project

This project is ideal for

• Learning the foundations of social engineering  
• Understanding why humans are targeted  
• Practising SOC style communication and analysis  
• Strengthening cybersecurity portfolio credibility  
• Demonstrating high-level understanding without relying on code  

No environment setup needed. This is an analyst-focused case study.

# ✅ What I Learned

• How attackers manipulate emotion and trust  
• Why humans are the most common entry point  
• How mitigation differs from detection in a real SOC  
• How to communicate human risk clearly and professionally  
• How multiple defensive layers reduce the chances of compromise  
• How to break down attacks into steps and next moves  

This is the exact mindset required in incident response, phishing triage, social engineering analysis and general security operations.

# 📚 Resources

• Cybersecurity awareness training frameworks  
• OWASP social engineering guidance  
• MITRE ATT&CK Initial Access techniques  
• CISA human-focused threat advisories  
• Industry social engineering case studies
